### Featuring custom animation

FeedDerpy.com features an interactive sprite sheet animation of a cartoon character named Derpy Hooves eating muffins. To feed muffins to the pony, the user clicks the basket of muffins near the top of the screen. I created the animations in Adobe Illustrator using existing artwork as a base and guide, and stitched the interactive animation together using JavaScript and CSS sprite sheet techniques.

### Tech Stack

[FeedDerpy.com](http://www.feedderpy.com/) was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The sprite sheet animations re-use frames from the master sprite sheet as part of several animation subroutines. The source code that powers FeedDerpy.com [is available on GitHub](https://github.com/MaxLaumeister/FeedDerpy) under the MIT license.
