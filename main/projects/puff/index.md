### Wield the power of the wind

Puff is a casual side-scrolling game that focuses on efficient navigation, rather than dexterity. By harnessing the power of wind in your mouse cursor, guide a dandelion seed (“Puff”) past obstacles so it can land safely and bloom into a dandelion.

I created this game in a two person team alongside [Andrew Paolini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-paolini-390169117) for the CMPS 80K Foundations of Game Design course at University of California, Santa Cruz. In addition to programming, I composed all of the music for Puff, and it was an Audio Award finalist at the 2012 UCSC Sammy Awards for game design.

### Tech Stack

Puff is written in [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), and uses extensive GML scripting for its physics, behaviors, and special effects. Puff is currently closed source.
