### Jelly physics are neat!

Immunogen is a casual 2D physics puzzle game written in Unity. I wrote it as part of a four person team for the senior game design sequence of the Computer Science: Game Design major at University of California, Santa Cruz. I was responsible for coming up with the game concept, creating original artwork and music for the game, and writing much of the game's programming. The game features jelly physics, so most objects in the game are able to deform and bounce back.

### Tech Stack

Immunogen is written using the [Unity3D game engine](https://unity3d.com/), uses custom jelly physics, and is currently closed source.
