  "readme": "# surge(.sh)\n\n> Publish web apps to a CDN with a single command and no setup required.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/surge.png?global=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/surge/)\n\nThis is the CLI client for the surge.sh hosted service. It’s what gets installed when you run `npm install -g surge`.\n\nThis CLI library manages access tokens locally and handles the upload and subsequent reporting when you publish a project using surge.\n\n## Usage\n\nIt’s easier to show than tell so let’s get to it! The following command will deploy the current working directory to the surge servers where the application will be available at sintaxi.com.\n\n    $ surge ./ sintaxi.com\n\nRun `surge --help` to see the following overview of the `surge` command...\n\n```\n  Surge - single-command web publishing. (v0.7.2)\n\n  Usage:\n    surge [options]\n\n  Options:\n    -p, --project       path to projects asset directory (./)\n    -d, --domain        domain of your project (<random>.surge.sh)\n    -e, --endpoint      domain of API server (surge.sh)\n    -a, --add           adds user to list of collaborators (email address)\n    -r, --remove        removes user from list of collaborators (email address)\n    -V, --version       show the version number\n    -h, --help          show this help message\n\n  Shorthand usage:\n    surge [project path] [domain]\n\n  Additional commands:\n    surge whoami        show who you are logged in as\n    surge logout        expire local token\n    surge login         only performs authentication step\n    surge list          list all domains you have access to\n\n  When in doubt, run surge from within you project directory.\n\n```\n\n## CDN Features\n\n- Custom CNAME & custom SSL\n- Fallback 404.html pages\n- HTML5 mode 200.html pages\n- Stays out of `git`s way\n- Supports clean URLs && trailing slashes `/`\n- Implicit signup\n- Supports CNAME files\n\nIf you’re using tools like Grunt, Gulp, or a static site generator like Jekyll, your files are output into a compile directory like `_site/`, `build/`, or `www/`. From the root of your project, pass Surge the path to this directory to upload your compiled assets.\n\n    surge www\n\nYou may also add this directory to your `.gitignore` to keep your compiled assets out of your Git history.\n",
