    <ul>
        <li>I graduated <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Cruz</a> in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design (highest honors).</li>
        <li>I'm pretty good at Tetris Attack.</li>
        <li>In 2011 I ran a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL15E0AC4F7B0CD8BA" target="_blank">Minecraft YouTube channel</a> that got 9 million views, and I was invited to Minecon.</li>
        <li>My favorite video game series is Paper Mario.</li>
        <li>I write <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D1B1B84D3BE770D" target="_blank">music for virtual orchestra</a> in my spare time. I also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL93Ao-kXHQuUVcQDf2llrR_YAUGr8x9uZ" target="_blank">punch custom music boxes</a>.</li>
        <li>I think crypto is pretty cool. I've got a public key hosted <a href="https://keybase.io/maxlaumeister" target="_blank">here</a>, if you're that kind of person too.</li>
        <li id="so_answers">I post answers to programming questions <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2234742/maximillian-laumeister">on Stack Overflow</a> in my free time.</li>
